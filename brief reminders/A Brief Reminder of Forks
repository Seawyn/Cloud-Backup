#Forks: A brief reminder

#To start of, one has to import the os library:
import os

#The fork instruction, in this project, will aid with server multitasking, more specifically, with simultaneus TCP and UDP connections all servers have to deal with.

#Using this instruction, a new process can be created thusly:
newpid = os.fork()

#Whereupon the processes will resume executing the code. We can then filter them using "if" statements:
if newpid == 0:
    print("A new child process is: ", os.getpid())
else:
    print("The parent process is: ", os.getpid())

#Examining the above code, one concludes that the child process has a pid of 0 (zero)

#After the child process has finished executing his part of the algorithm, we can then end the process with the exit instruction:
os._exit(0)
