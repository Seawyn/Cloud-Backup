#SIGINT: A Brief Reminder

#To start off, one must import the signal library:
import signal

#SIGINT comes in handy in this project, more specifically in the debugging section, since terminating the program too early can cause issues with port usage,
#which causes the connection to be rejected, saying that the address is already in use

#The function that specifies what the signal caused by the keyboard combination "CTRL + C" should do can be defined thously:
import sys

def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    print("Why did you interrupt me?")
    sys.exit(0)

def main():
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
    print("Calculating stuff")
    num = 0
    while True:
        num += 1

#Inspecting the above code, one concludes that terminating the algorithm with SIGINT, interrupts the continuous incrementation of the variable "num" and calls the "signal_handler" function

#It's important to note that SIGINT must be declared (in the line "signal.signal(...)"), otherwise, the behavior won't work
